                    <p>
                        As you can imagine, most of my scientific interests are in Informatics. 
                        Specifically, I like programming microcontrollers, such as Arduino. 
                        I also love video games. Some of my favorite video games are Grand Theft Auto and Forza Horizon. 
                        In my free time, I like to study the Unity game engine and my goal is to create something like a clone game that combines GTA and Forza Horizon games, just for fun and experimentation <u style='color:red;'><b style='color:red;'>NOT</b></u> for commercial purposes, putting my personal details on this project. 
                        The purpose of this portfolio is to demonstrate some of the work that I have done to achieve this and also my skills in programming.
                        As you can see in the following videos and photos, I have created a virtual representation of myself (avatar) as the main character of the game. 
                        The project, of course, is not completed, it requires much time and I work on it only when I have free time. I use two programs for its development, Cinema 4D for 3d modeling and Unity game engine for the building. Many times I use animations from Mixamo or in rare cases I can do motion capture with Kinect V1, using MoCap asset in Unity. 
                        I also modify ready 3d models from Sketchfab and Gtainside. I take 3d models from those sites and after I modify them into Cinema4d, to fit them to the requirements of the game, I import them into Unity in fbx format and I use some of the Unity assets, such as Realistic Car Controller (to simulate the driving physics of a vehicle) for example, to give them life. 
                        In the following examples, you will see a list of some very specific assets, that I am using. I intend to use some of this little experience and knowledge for developing my master's thesis in "Informatics Engineering".

                            A program with C++ (written in my spare time while doing my military service), that solves a rubik's cube. I'm planning to create an app in Unity in conjunction with an Arduino robot with servo motors, that will solve the cube.
                            You can test the code by calling different shuffle moves for the cube in the main function. The only condition is that the cube must be kept in the same orientation both on shuffling and on solving.
                            You can use the notation image (taken from the internet), if you don't know the moves.

                            A program written in Matlab for the Artificial Intelligence course. The aim was to study the Depth First Search algorithm through the classic Missionaries and Cannibals problem. Specifically a graphical representation of the problem
							had to be created and then DFS applied to it, to find its solution (which is the easy part, using Matlab's ready-made dfsearch function). The hardest part (which I focused on the most) is creating the visual and sound effects
							for the game. Unfortunately the sound effects are not captured by the video. To save time we only see the shortest path to the solution.

                        <h3>Driving Car</h3>
                        <p>
                            In this video I'm driving my favorite car (BMW 850CSI).
                            The car model is from Gtainside (website, which contains game mods for all games in the Grand Theft Auto series). I converted it
                            in fbx format and modified it, using Cinema4d. The driving physics are from the Realistic Car Controller asset, which I also modified, so that the car has working dashboard
                            and also better gear changes and camera behavior. I've also added a script for mesh deformation, when the car hits an object. I also used render texture for interior mirrors and raycasts
                            for the opening parts (as seen, when it is close to the wall, the door does not open). Driver animations are done with FinalIK
                            asset, which uses Inverse Kinematics to adjust the position and rotation of the driver's bodyparts, to fit.

                        <p>
                            As you can see in this video, the player character is my self. Specifically I created my avatar (only the head), using a photo of mine. I uploaded that photo to Avatar SDK webpage, which creates 3d avatar models from selfies. After that, I found the body in Skecthfab, and I connected the body with the head in Cinema 4d. After I created the virtual version of my self, I used Adobe Mixamo website, which can rig a humanoid character automatically. Then I used
                            Third Person Motion Controller, to give to my character life. I also used some other assets like LipSync, MecFootPlacer, ThirdPersonCamera, etc., to setup other parameters, like the proper feet placement on the ground, the camera's colliders, the motion of eyes and the blink of eyelashes.

                            This short video was created with Unity and Adobe Premiere. It is an attempt to create something similar to the strip club in Grand Theft Auto 5. Specifically what I did was to create the interior scene and take some snapshots in Unity, using the Recorder package. I also used splines for the moving camera. Then I edited these videos in Adobe Premiere.

                            This is a sample that I created in just three days for the Typhoon class submarine, using 3 assets (Dynamic water physics 2, Lux water and HUD navigation system). It is about a naval simulation project and I would like to try to build something similar to "World of Warships".

                        <h3>Semester project on "Realistic Multimedia and Animation"</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is the project I created for the Maths and Physics for Game Developers Course I took in my master's program. Its purpose is for the student to create physics from scratch for a specific topic of his choice (I chose automotive physics), so that the theory can be applied to reality. Specifically I created it in Unity in HDR pipeline. It's a little blurry because of the video recorder's compression. You can read more about it in its documentation and watch it in the video.

                            Another project on the Maths and Physics for Game Developers Course. The points of interest are mainly two. The first is the shattered version of the alienship, which I created after importing the 3d model into Cinema4D and then attaching the <b>Voronoi Fracturing</b> component of MoGraph tools. The second is the timer, which actually is a <b>green-screen</b> video, using a color selection shader to make the background transparent. Saddly, because of jpeg encoding of the video frames (instead of png), the colors in pixels between the digits and the background have been mixed and therefore we can see that the frame of the digits is slightly green.
